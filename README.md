# Python Programming Tasks: Data & Logic

This repository contains my practical solutions for 5 Python tasks. The project shows how to handle data, use functions, and work with files like JSON and Excel-style data (Pandas).

## What is in this project?

### Task 01: Reusable Functions
* **Goal:** Stop repeating code.
* **What I did:** Created a function called `calculate_stats` that takes any list of numbers and automatically finds the average (mean) and the highest value (max).

### Task 02: Data Tools Library
* **Goal:** Build a small "toolbox" for data.
* **What I did:** Wrote functions to clean and prepare data, like removing outliers and splitting data for testing, which is very important for any program.

### Task 03: Cleaning Data with Pandas
* **Goal:** Fix "dirty" data.
* **What I did:** Used the Pandas library to fix a product list. I removed "$" signs from prices, filled in missing numbers, and categorized products as "low" or "high" price.

### Task 04: Student Database Analysis
* **Goal:** Extract information from complex lists.
* **What I did:** Wrote code to navigate through a "nested" list of students. It calculates each student's GPA based on their credits and finds the student with the best grades.

### Task 05: Working with JSON Files
* **Goal:** Save and load data.
* **What I did:** Made the program read settings from a `config.json` file and save the final results into a new `results.json` file. This ensures data is never lost.
